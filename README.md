### 🌀 **ENSNAPIFACATION**
*This is basically Snap, but more intense.*

Fast. Loud. Chaotic. Match cards, spot patterns, steal piles—before anyone else does. Hesitation loses. Confidence counts.

**Arguing is allowed.**

---

### ⚡ **QAZACATISM**
*Someone's close. Everyone notices. Everything goes wrong.*

Collect two Super cards to win instantly—but the moment you're close, everyone's coming for you. Cancel, reverse, interrupt, survive.

**If it feels unfair, it probably is.**
